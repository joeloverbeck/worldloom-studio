name: code-review
description: Review the changes since a fixed point (commit, branch, tag, or merge-base) along two axes — Standards (does the code follow this repo's documented coding standards?) and Spec (does the code match what the originating issue/PRD asked for?). Prefers parallel sub-agents when policy permits, otherwise runs a local two-axis fallback. Use when the user wants to review a branch, a PR, work-in-progress changes, or asks to "review since X".
---

Two-axis review of the diff between `HEAD` and a fixed point the user supplies:

- **Standards** — does the code conform to this repo's documented coding standards?
- **Spec** — does the code faithfully implement the originating issue / PRD / spec?

Both axes should run as **parallel sub-agents** when the available tool policy permits it, so they don't pollute each other's context. Tool availability alone is not permission: if the sub-agent tool policy requires explicit user authorization and the user did not grant it, treat sub-agents as policy-blocked. If sub-agents are unavailable or policy-blocked, run both axes locally in separate sections and document the deviation.

The issue tracker should have been provided to you — run `/setup-matt-pocock-skills` if `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` is missing.

## Process

### 1. Pin the fixed point

Whatever the user said is the fixed point — a commit SHA, branch name, tag, `main`, `HEAD~5`, etc. If they didn't specify one, ask for it.

Exception: when invoked as part of implementation closeout after the implementation has already been committed locally, default to `HEAD~1` unless the user or calling skill supplied a different fixed point.

If review findings are fixed in one or more follow-up commits, keep the original fixed point for any final or residual implementation-closeout review. Use the new `HEAD~1` only when explicitly reviewing just the follow-up fix commit; otherwise it drops the original implementation diff from the review frame.

Capture the fixed-point input, the resolved fixed-point SHA (`git rev-parse <fixed-point>`), the reviewed HEAD SHA (`git rev-parse HEAD`), the durable diff command `git diff <resolved-fixed-point-sha>...HEAD` (three-dot, so the comparison is against the merge-base), and the list of commits via `git log <resolved-fixed-point-sha>..HEAD --oneline`. Use the resolved SHA in durable closeout artifacts; relative refs such as `HEAD~1` are acceptable as the input, but not as the only durable review frame.

Validator expectation: in the durable review frame, write the diff command with the resolved fixed-point SHA itself, for example `git diff abc1234...HEAD`. Do not leave `HEAD~1...HEAD`, `main...HEAD`, or another relative/name ref as the only diff command after recording the resolved SHA.

Run `git status --short` before fixing the review inputs. If the worktree is dirty, state whether the review covers only the committed diff or also staged/unstaged work. The default implementation-closeout review covers committed changes only; label dirty files as excluded unless the user asked for a work-in-progress review. For work-in-progress review, add `git diff --cached` and `git diff` as explicit inputs to both axes, alongside the committed diff when relevant.

Before going further, confirm the fixed point resolves (`git rev-parse <fixed-point>`) and the diff is non-empty. A bad ref or empty diff should fail here — not inside two parallel sub-agents.

### 2. Identify the spec source

Look for the originating spec, in this order:

1. Issue references in the commit messages (`#123`, `Closes #45`, GitLab `!67`, etc.) — fetch via the workflow in `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.
2. When invoked as part of implementation closeout, the originating PRD/issues already resolved by the implementation workflow count as the spec source; cite those issue numbers and any created spec file.
3. A path the user passed as an argument.
4. A PRD/spec file under `docs/specs/`, `docs/`, or `.scratch/` matching the branch name or feature.
5. If nothing is found, ask the user where the spec is. If they say there isn't one, the **Spec** sub-agent will skip and report "no spec available".

If the chosen issue, PRD, or spec has a `## Principles` section, read `docs/principles/README.md` for the authority order and conformance rule, then read any named principle documents and ADRs needed to judge the change. Treat those principle and ADR references as part of the Spec axis: they are conformance requirements, not optional background. If the diff contradicts one, flag it explicitly in the review using the repo's contradiction wording.

### 3. Identify the standards sources

Anything in the repo that documents how code should be written, such as `CODING_STANDARDS.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

Also include root agent instructions such as `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`, plus repo agent docs they point to, when they define coding, review, tracker, or verification conventions. Principle documents identified in step 2 belong to the Spec axis unless they also state a coding or workflow convention.

On top of whatever the repo documents, the Standards axis always carries the **smell baseline** below — a fixed set of Fowler code smells (_Refactoring_, ch.3) that applies even when a repo documents nothing. Two rules bind it:

- **The repo overrides.** A documented repo standard always wins; where it endorses something the baseline would flag, suppress the smell.
- **Always a judgement call.** Each smell is a labelled heuristic ("possible Feature Envy"), never a hard violation — and, like any standard here, skip anything tooling already enforces.

Each smell reads *what it is* → *how to fix*; match it against the diff:

- **Mysterious Name** — a function, variable, or type whose name doesn't reveal what it does or holds. → rename it; if no honest name comes, the design's murky.
- **Duplicated Code** — the same logic shape appears in more than one hunk or file in the change. → extract the shared shape, call it from both.
- **Feature Envy** — a method that reaches into another object's data more than its own. → move the method onto the data it envies.
- **Data Clumps** — the same few fields or params keep travelling together (a type wanting to be born). → bundle them into one type, pass that.
- **Primitive Obsession** — a primitive or string standing in for a domain concept that deserves its own type. → give the concept its own small type.
- **Repeated Switches** — the same `switch`/`if`-cascade on the same type recurs across the change. → replace with polymorphism, or one map both sites share.
- **Shotgun Surgery** — one logical change forces scattered edits across many files in the diff. → gather what changes together into one module.
- **Divergent Change** — one file or module is edited for several unrelated reasons. → split so each module changes for one reason.
- **Speculative Generality** — abstraction, parameters, or hooks added for needs the spec doesn't have. → delete it; inline back until a real need shows.
- **Message Chains** — long `a.b().c().d()` navigation the caller shouldn't depend on. → hide the walk behind one method on the first object.
- **Middle Man** — a class or function that mostly just delegates onward. → cut it, call the real target direct.
- **Refused Bequest** — a subclass or implementer that ignores or overrides most of what it inherits. → drop the inheritance, use composition.

### 4. Run both review axes

Use the available sub-agent mechanism, if permitted, with two independent read-only review tasks. Prefer running the axes in parallel; if the tool surface uses different role names, choose the closest general read-only reviewer role. If sub-agent tools may be deferred or lazy-loaded, perform the minimal tool-discovery check needed to inspect the surfaced sub-agent policy before deciding. If the discovered policy requires explicit user authorization to spawn agents and the user did not grant it, record `policy-blocked` and do not spawn. If the discovered policy says spawning agents requires explicit user authorization and the user did not explicitly ask for sub-agents, delegation, parallel agents, or parallel agent work, the discovery check is complete: record `policy-blocked`, skip sub-agent prompt inspection/preparation, and proceed directly to local fallback. If sub-agents are unavailable or policy-blocked, run both axes locally against the same fixed point, keep the analysis separated under the same headings, and state that the fallback path was used.

After collecting sub-agent outputs, close every review sub-agent or session started for the review before handing back to `implement` or reporting completion. Record each review sub-agent ID and final status in the review evidence. Also record `Review subagent cleanup:` with one disposition per axis: `closed`, `close operation unavailable after terminal completion`, `auto-disposed after terminal completion`, or an explicit failed/still-running cleanup state. When the tool surface has no close primitive, wait for terminal completion and record the unavailable-close disposition; do not relabel terminal completion as closed.

When local fallback is required, read [fallback-evidence.md](fallback-evidence.md) before reviewing or handing back to `implement`. It owns the non-bypassable fallback gate, local fallback checklist, mandatory durable output, body validator flags, and caller handoff stop.

For normal and fallback review alike, use validator-safe prose in compact review, TDD, audit, and evidence-identity values: avoid HTML-like angle tokens such as a backticked body tag and spell them in prose, for example `document body`. Follow [evidence-identities.md](evidence-identities.md) before proof cleanup as well as before handoff. A published current artifact is not safe to remove until closeout is complete and its retained-or-removed disposition is recorded; after removal, durable evidence must not imply that the local artifact remains inspectable.

Normal review immediate-fix handoff stop for `implement`: when sub-agent review ran normally and any findings were fixed before closeout, inspect the durable sink before returning the closeout-ready `Review:` line. It must contain the exact `Initial Standards outcome`, `Initial Spec outcome`, `Final Standards outcome`, `Final Spec outcome`, `Findings found`, `Fixes made`, `Review subagents`, `Review subagent cleanup`, `Browser/manual evidence freshness`, `Browser/manual console state`, `Backend process currentness`, `Evidence identity refresh`, `Verification rerun`, `Residual findings`, and `Axis summary` fields; use the explicit no-browser N/A values when browser/manual evidence was not used. Fill the shared block from [evidence-identities.md](evidence-identities.md), whether or not TDD ran. When TDD/review-fix evidence was required, it must also contain `TDD/review-fix evidence` and `TDD closeout gate`. Re-read [the canonical TDD closeout contract](../tdd/closeout-evidence.md) before filling those TDD fields; the current contract requires `Acceptance atom map:`, `Acceptance sequence map:`, `Evidence-only proof server preflight:`, `Evidence-only backend process currentness:`, and `Evidence identity refresh:` in the preflight, `atoms:`, `proof surfaces:`, and `sequence:` in every compact row, `proof server preflight` in the literal gate, and `Backend process currentness:` plus the shared identity refresh in a review-fix addendum. Reuse the same identity block rather than duplicating it. If any required field is missing or label-drifted, stop and fill it before handing back to `implement`.

Normal review no-fix handoff stop for `implement`: when sub-agent review ran normally and no findings were fixed before closeout, preserve this compact handoff evidence in the conversation, implementation ledger, or durable closeout sink before returning the closeout-ready `Review:` line:

- **Review subagents**: `<Standards and Spec sub-agent IDs and final statuses>`
- **Review subagent cleanup**: `<Standards <closed / close operation unavailable after terminal completion / auto-disposed after terminal completion>; Spec <same / explicit failed or still-running state>>`
- **Axis summary**: `Standards <count/worst>, Spec <count/worst>`
- **Residual findings**: `<none / accepted residual records below; no unhandled findings beyond accepted residuals>`
- **Accepted residual**: `<title>` when a finding is intentionally accepted
  - **Axis**: `<Standards / Spec>`
  - **Source**: `<reviewer finding plus file/hunk or acceptance source>`
  - **Rationale**: `<why closeout is allowed without a fix>`
  - **Revisit trigger**: `<concrete condition / N/A because permanently accepted judgement>`
- **Parent PRD coverage**: `<N/A / parent PRD row present / same-sink exact audit rows cited>` when parent PRD closeout is in scope
- **Browser/manual N/A checked**: `<N/A / exact issue or PRD criterion plus unchanged browser contract/routes/rendered behavior/validation response/fixtures/action path>` when issue-level browser/manual N/A is part of the acceptance source
- **Browser/manual evidence freshness**: `<final-tree rerun evidence / justified not affected with changed path and targeted proof / blocked or stale reason / N/A because no browser/manual evidence was used>` when browser/manual evidence was used or the normal validator is run with `--browser`
- **Browser/manual console state**: `<0 errors and 0 warnings / classified unrelated output with evidence / blocked reason / N/A because no browser/manual evidence was used>` when browser/manual evidence was used or the normal validator is run with `--browser`
- **Backend process currentness**: `<server command and watch/reload mode; process or port ownership; restart/reload proof; expected API field/behavior probe; when Current evidence identities names non-none fixture paths under --browser, stateful fixture snapshot method <method>; snapshot source <source>; expected-state probe <probe>, or N/A because no stateful fixture was copied / N/A because browser proof has no backend/API dependency / N/A because no browser/manual evidence was used / blocked because ...>`; always include this field and use the explicit no-browser N/A when applicable
- **Spec sequence coverage**: `<sequence: ordered events plus the proof that observes their order / sequence: N/A because ...>` when an issue coverage table does not carry per-row sequence dispositions
- **Evidence identity refresh**: `<paste the complete shared block from evidence-identities.md; required whether or not TDD ran>`
- **Review evidence line**: `<copy-ready Review: line below>`

Before filling a normal-review implementation closeout body, run `node .claude/skills/implement/scripts/build-closeout-body.mjs <manifest.json> --audit-input <audit.md> --output <body.md> --parent <issue> --review normal --size-plan --require-headroom`, carrying every other applicable closeout flag into the same command. If the result is `low-headroom` or `exceeds-limit`, stop before filling evidence and generate disjoint subset manifests plus matching audit chunks with repeatable `--select <issue[:check-id[,check-id...]]>` arguments to `.claude/skills/implement/scripts/build-acceptance-manifest.mjs`. The subsets must be disjoint and collectively cover the full authoritative manifest; validate every completed chunk against its matching subset before the compact closing body cites it.

When the normal-review sink is a local body file, run `node .claude/skills/code-review/scripts/validate-review-normal-body.mjs <body.md>` before handing back. Add `--immediate-fix` when findings were fixed, `--parent-prd` when parent PRD closeout is in scope, `--child-family` for PRD child issue families, `--issue-set` when two or more sibling issues are reviewed without parent/child semantics, `--browser` when browser/manual evidence was used, `--tdd` when the body includes normal TDD closeout evidence, `--tdd-parent-rollup` instead of `--tdd` when that evidence uses the parent-rollup compact table, and `--closing` when the exact body will be posted or linked for tracker closeout. When closing validation includes TDD evidence, also pass `--expected-final-sha "$(git rev-parse HEAD)"`; the normal validator forwards that live SHA to nested TDD validation. Closing mode enforces a 65,536-byte body maximum by default; `--max-bytes <positive integer>` may lower that ceiling or match another tracker's documented contract, but must not be used to bypass GitHub's limit. `--parent-prd`, `--child-family`, and `--issue-set` each require `--acceptance-manifest <path>` generated from saved exact issue JSON; combine parent/child scope flags when both are in scope, and include every reviewed issue number in the manifest. The normal validator forwards that manifest and the applicable scope flags to nested TDD validation, and `--tdd-parent-rollup` itself requires the same manifest even when no other scope flag is present. If no local body file exists, apply the same manifest, table, sequence, identity, size, and closing-sink checks manually and record that the script was N/A because the sink was not local.

When invoked by the repo `implement` skill, also emit one closeout-ready review evidence line after the two-axis report, matching the caller's format:

- `Review: code-review against <fixed point>; outcome <no findings / findings fixed in SHA ...>; verification rerun <commands>.`
- `Review: code-review against <fixed point>; outcome accepted residuals recorded <count/source/rationale/revisit trigger>; unhandled findings none beyond accepted residuals; verification rerun <commands>.`
- `Review fallback: <why code-review could not run>; standards/spec result <...>; fixes <none / SHA ...>; verification rerun <commands>.`

If fallback was used, the closeout-ready line must start `Review fallback:` exactly. Do not use `Review:` for fallback reviews.

If normal sub-agent review reports accepted residuals, do not summarize the outcome as `no findings`. The durable handoff must record each residual separately with `Accepted residual:`, `Axis:`, `Source:`, `Rationale:`, and `Revisit trigger:` fields, and must state that no unhandled findings remain beyond accepted residuals. `Revisit trigger:` must name a concrete condition that reopens the decision, or say `N/A because permanently accepted judgement` when the decision is intentionally permanent.

If review reports no findings, or only accepted residuals, and no files change after review, `verification rerun` may state that no rerun was needed after review because the unchanged final tree already passed named gates. In that case, cite those gates explicitly and keep the implementation commit SHA as the reviewed SHA.

For behavior-changing review fixes that touch UI, route handlers, browser-consumed API shapes, fixtures, or an action path adjacent to earlier browser/manual evidence, `not affected` is acceptable only when the review evidence names the changed path, explains why the earlier evidence route/action path and browser-consumed API/fixtures were untouched, and reruns targeted proof for the changed path. Otherwise rerun the browser/manual evidence on the final tree or mark it blocked/stale.

When browser/manual proof consumes a backend, reachability alone is not currentness. Before accepting the final UI result, record `Backend process currentness:` with the server command and watch/reload mode, process or port ownership from the proof's execution context, restart/reload proof after relevant server/API edits, and the expected API field or behavior probe. When `Current evidence identities:` names non-`none` fixture paths, also record `stateful fixture snapshot method`, `snapshot source`, and `expected-state probe`, or the exact disposition `N/A because no stateful fixture was copied`. For SQLite with possible live WAL state, use `.backup` or a checkpoint-aware copy; raw `cp` is not snapshot proof. If a stale process or fixture caused an error or currentness is uncertain, restart the proof-owned backend, rebuild the fixture consistently, and rerun in a clean browser session. Use a reasoned N/A only when no browser/manual evidence was used or the browser proof has no backend/API dependency.

If the later review fix is non-semantic formatting, comment wording, documentation, or closeout text, inspect the diff and record `Browser/manual evidence freshness: not affected because changed path <path> is <non-semantic reason>; earlier evidence route/action/API/fixture <route/action/API/fixture> is untouched; diff inspected and targeted proof <command> passed` instead of rerunning browser/manual evidence.

If the final browser/manual proof ran on the same tracked file content that was later committed, do not force a fake rerun only to attach a SHA. Record `Browser/manual evidence freshness: not affected because git commit metadata only; no tracked file content changed after the proof; earlier evidence route/action/API/fixture <route/action/API/fixture> is untouched; targeted proof git diff HEAD -- <owned files> passed or was empty`.

**Standards sub-agent prompt** — include:

- The full diff command and commit list.
- Any staged/unstaged WIP diff inputs captured in step 1.
- The list of standards-source files you found in step 3, **plus the smell baseline from step 3** pasted in full — the sub-agent has no other access to it.
- The brief: "Report — per file/hunk where relevant — (a) every place the diff violates a documented standard: cite the standard (file + the rule); and (b) any baseline smell you spot: name it and quote the hunk. Distinguish hard violations from judgement calls — documented-standard breaches can be hard, but baseline smells are always judgement calls, and a documented repo standard overrides the baseline. Skip anything tooling enforces. Under 400 words."

**Spec sub-agent prompt** — include:

- The diff command and commit list.
- Any staged/unstaged WIP diff inputs captured in step 1.
- The path(s), issue number(s), or fetched contents for every spec source.
- If the spec source is a PRD child issue family or two or more sibling issues, require a compact per-issue coverage table: `Issue | Acceptance source | Evidence reviewed | Findings/residuals`. Every reviewed issue should have a row before reporting zero residual Spec findings.
- If the parent PRD itself is being closed by the implementation workflow, require a parent PRD row in that table, or a citation to exact same-sink audit rows that cover the parent PRD's solution, implementation decisions, testing decisions, principles, and child map.
- If a reviewed issue, parent PRD row, PRD criterion, or acceptance source contains a named list of required items, require the `Acceptance source` cell to enumerate concrete items such as `AC1`, `criterion 2`, or checklist IDs, split them into multiple rows, or cite adjacent exact acceptance table rows/range before reporting zero residual Spec findings. Broad issue or parent summaries are not enough.
- For parent PRD user-story inventories, require one keyed row per individual `USN` in the coverage table or an adjacent keyed map. A broad range such as `US1-US36` may identify the inventory boundary but does not replace individual story rows.
- If an acceptance source uses a composite term, require the reviewer to resolve it through authoritative issue/PRD definitions, implementation decisions, glossaries, or named contracts, then enumerate its atoms and required proof surfaces in the `Acceptance source` cell or an adjacent keyed map before reporting zero residual Spec findings. For example, `provenance` may mean `actor + timestamp + flow step` across `API + report + browser`; evidence for the umbrella noun alone is incomplete.
- Require every zero-residual issue coverage row to include `sequence:` in its `Acceptance source`: name the ordered events and the proof that observes their order, or use `sequence: N/A because ...` when the criterion is not sequence-sensitive. Independently observed states do not prove a required transition order. When no issue coverage table applies, require a `Spec sequence coverage:` field with the same ordered-proof or justified-N/A shape before reporting zero Spec findings.
- For routed, guided-flow, or multi-surface UI work, require the reviewer to verify acceptance on the production route and action path the user actually reaches, and to reject legacy, adjacent, inactive, or full-workspace-only surfaces as proof for active routed requirements.
- If an acceptance item says browser/manual proof is N/A, require the reviewer to verify that the diff does not change browser contract, routes, rendered behavior, validation response, fixtures, or action path. If any of those browser-consumed surfaces changed, the reviewer must require browser/manual evidence or report a residual finding.
- Require an exact-acceptance challenge before zero Spec findings: every acceptance item must map to evidence for the exact condition the source names, and broad `equivalent`, `representative`, `active-route replay`, or nearby-surface proof must be rejected unless the spec explicitly permits substitution.
- If an acceptance item requires cold external LLM, fresh subagent, packet-read, credentialed service, or other nonlocal proof, require the reviewer to verify the exact artifact/result, blocker, or same-sink audit row before reporting zero residual Spec findings; repo-local tests alone are not proof for those criteria.
- Any `## Principles` section from the spec source, plus `docs/principles/README.md` and named principle/ADR docs read in step 2.
- The brief: "Report: (a) requirements the spec asked for that are missing or partial; (b) behaviour in the diff that wasn't asked for (scope creep); (c) requirements that look implemented but where the implementation looks wrong. Quote the spec line for each finding. Under 400 words."

If the spec is missing, skip the Spec sub-agent and note this in the final report.

### 5. Aggregate

Present the two reports under `## Standards` and `## Spec` headings, verbatim or lightly cleaned. Do **not** merge or rerank findings — the two axes are deliberately separate (see _Why two axes_). Do not omit these two-axis headings just because findings were fixed immediately; if time is short, use compact content under `## Standards` and `## Spec`.

If local fallback was used during implementation closeout, emit the mandatory local fallback block from step 4 before the implementation pre-close audit. The pre-close audit may duplicate review evidence, but it does not substitute for the delegation policy source, `## Standards`, `## Spec`, and any issue coverage table required by this skill.

If the review resumes, compacts, or is interrupted before final reporting, revalidate the review frame before presenting results: rerun fixed-point resolution, `git status --short`, the non-empty diff check, and the commit list, then confirm the standards-source and spec-source lists are still present in context. If any source list is missing or stale, reconstruct it before reporting.

End with a one-line summary: total findings per axis, and the worst issue _within each axis_ (if any). Don't pick a single winner across axes — that's the reranking the separation exists to prevent.

When this review is part of implementation closeout, report findings first. If fixes are made immediately, rerun the relevant verification, state whether the commit was amended or followed by a new commit, and include the review outcome in the implementation closeout evidence. After each review-fix amend or follow-up commit, rerun the affected review axis, or the full two-axis review when the fix could affect both axes, against the original fixed point through final `HEAD` before reporting `Residual findings: none`; if an axis is not rerun, record why the original review still covers the final tree. When a finding requires a behavior change, invoke the repo `tdd` skill where possible: add or adjust the smallest assertion first and run it red before fixing. If the red command fails for the wrong reason (missing file, generic invariant, unrelated assertion, or any failure that does not prove the intended behavior), record `partial red - wrong reason: <reason>`, then add or adjust the smallest assertion that fails for the intended behavior before patching; if impossible, record an explicit red-first skipped reason. If the code was already fixed to protect the tree or unblock verification, record that red-first was skipped and why. For behavior-changing review fixes, generic wording such as `fixed and covered` is not enough; the closeout must include the red command/failure or an explicit `red-first skipped because ...` reason. If a review finding is missing proof or coverage only, add the smallest assertion and run it; if it passes without code changes, record `coverage-only review fix; red-first N/A because behavior already existed and no code changed`; if it fails, treat the finding as missing behavior and use the normal TDD red-green path. If a review finding is Standards-only, ADR-only, or conformance-only and the fix does not change acceptance behavior, record that acceptance behavior did not change, use `red-first skipped because Standards-only/conformance-only fix did not change behavior` when TDD/review-fix evidence is required, rerun the affected review axis against the original fixed point through final `HEAD`, and state why any unrerun axis still covers the final tree. If a review fix touches UI, route handlers, browser-consumed API shapes, fixtures, or an action path covered by earlier browser/manual evidence, rerun that evidence on the final tree or record an explicit blocked/stale reason.

For immediate-fix closeout, use this compact shape after the two axis reports:

- **Initial Standards outcome**: `<count/worst plus findings before fixes>`
- **Initial Spec outcome**: `<count/worst plus findings before fixes>`
- **Final Standards outcome**: `<count/worst after re-review against the original fixed point through final HEAD>`
- **Final Spec outcome**: `<count/worst after re-review against the original fixed point through final HEAD>`
- **Findings found**: `<count and short titles, or none>`
- **Fixes made**: `<files/behavior changed, proof/coverage added, or none>`
- **Review subagents**: `<Standards/Spec initial and final review sub-agent IDs and final statuses, or N/A because local fallback was used>`
- **Review subagent cleanup**: `<Standards <closed / close operation unavailable after terminal completion / auto-disposed after terminal completion>; Spec <same / explicit failed or still-running state> / N/A because local fallback was used>`
- **TDD/review-fix evidence**: `<red command/failure per behavior-changing fix, partial red - wrong reason: <reason> plus follow-up intended red if applicable, coverage-only review fix reason, red-first skipped because Standards-only/conformance-only fix did not change behavior, explicit red-first skipped because ..., or linked TDD review-fix addendum>`
- **Spec sequence coverage**: `<sequence: ordered events plus observing proof / sequence: N/A because ...>` when issue rows do not carry it
- **TDD closeout gate**: `<canonical TDD closeout preflight, compact rows, review-fix addendum, and full fielded gate from ../tdd/closeout-evidence.md present or explicitly linked; includes Pre-red recovery status, Acceptance atom map, Acceptance sequence map, per-row atoms:, proof surfaces:, and sequence:, Evidence-only proof server preflight:, Evidence-only backend process currentness, Evidence identity refresh with historical red identities, Backend process currentness for review fixes, and Evidence-only browser console state when browser/manual evidence-only rows exist: TDD evidence gate passed: durable sink <conversation/comment URL/stable issue reference before tracker URL exists>; compact table/header <present after structural check/equivalent fields present after structural check>; seams accounted for <all listed / exceptions named>; CONTEXT.md status <present/absent/N/A>; ADRs/principles/docs status <present/N/A>; sequence evidence <present/N/A>; evidence identities <present/N/A>; partial-red / red-first skip reasons <none/listed>; evidence-only rows <none/listed>; proof server preflight <present/N/A>; existing-test contract-change rows <none / listed expectation-rewrite rows> / N/A because no tdd skill was invoked>`
- **Verification rerun**: `<commands and browser/manual checks>`
- **Browser/manual evidence freshness**: `<browser smoke rerun passed on final tree for route/action/API/fixture <route/action/API/fixture> with observed outcome <outcome> / rerun evidence on final tree / not affected because changed path <path> is outside the earlier evidence route/action/API/fixture <route/action/API/fixture> and targeted proof <command> passed / not affected because changed path <path> is non-semantic formatting, comment wording, documentation, or closeout text; earlier evidence route/action/API/fixture <route/action/API/fixture> is untouched; diff inspected and targeted proof <command> passed / not affected because git commit metadata only; no tracked file content changed after the proof; earlier evidence route/action/API/fixture <route/action/API/fixture> is untouched; targeted proof git diff HEAD -- <owned files> passed or was empty / explicit blocked or stale reason / N/A because no browser/manual evidence was used>`
- **Browser/manual console state**: `<0 errors and 0 warnings / classified unrelated output with evidence / rerun clean session because HMR, reused session, or agent-induced setup/request error tainted proof / N/A because no browser/manual evidence was used>`
- **Backend process currentness**: `<server command and watch/reload mode; process or port ownership; restart/reload proof; expected API field/behavior probe; when Current evidence identities names non-none fixture paths under --browser, stateful fixture snapshot method <method>; snapshot source <source>; expected-state probe <probe>, or N/A because no stateful fixture was copied / N/A because browser proof has no backend/API dependency / N/A because no browser/manual evidence was used / blocked because ...>`
- **Evidence identity refresh**: `<paste the complete shared block from evidence-identities.md; refresh it after every review fix or evidence rerun>`
- **Commit handling**: `<unchanged implementation commit SHA / amended commit SHA / follow-up commit SHA / no commit yet>`
- **Residual findings**: `<remaining Standards and Spec findings after affected/full-axis re-review against the original fixed point through final HEAD, or none; use the accepted-residual record shape above for each intentionally accepted finding>`
- **Parent PRD coverage**: `<N/A / parent PRD row present / same-sink exact audit rows cited>` when parent PRD closeout is in scope
- **Review evidence line**: `<copy-ready Review: line above>`
- **Axis summary**: `Standards <count/worst>, Spec <count/worst>`

## Why two axes

A change can pass one axis and fail the other:

- Code that follows every standard but implements the wrong thing → **Standards pass, Spec fail.**
- Code that does exactly what the issue asked but breaks the project's conventions → **Spec pass, Standards fail.**

Reporting them separately stops one axis from masking the other.
