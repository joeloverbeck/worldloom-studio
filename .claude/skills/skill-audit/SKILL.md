# Skill Audit

Analyze a skill against the work done in the current Claude Code session to determine whether it has issues, could be improved, or needs new features. **Report only** during the audit — never modify the target skill. Editing happens only in the optional follow-up-implementation phase, and only when the user requests it.

## Invocation

```
/skill-audit <path-to-skill-directory>
```

Example: `/skill-audit .claude/skills/research-brief`. The argument is the skill directory; the framework resolves `SKILL.md` within it. If the exact path doesn't resolve, glob `<path>*/SKILL.md` then `<path>**/SKILL.md` — use a single unique match and note the correction; on zero or multiple matches, stop and report the error.

## Audit checklist (Steps 1–7)

Steps 1–7 are the audit. Step 8 (follow-up implementation) fires only if the user requests it after the report.

1. **Read the target skill.** Read its `SKILL.md` and parse name, description, and content. If it ships a `references/` or `templates/` directory, list that directory first so per-finding suggestions can cite exact file paths. (A Read is satisfied by in-context content from earlier this session; re-read only after compaction, or if the skill was modified this session.)

2. **Read alignment documents.**
   - If a root `CLAUDE.md` exists, read it; if absent, treat that as normal and skip the CLAUDE.md alignment check. Always check the live repo; absence is normal, but do not assume it. (In-context content from an earlier Read this session — including a session-start system reminder — satisfies this, per Step 1's allowance; re-read only after compaction or if it changed.) A per-user global `CLAUDE.md` surfaced in session context still counts.
   - **Meta-tooling carve-out**: the target skills in this repo are process/tooling skills (e.g., `research-brief`, `skill-audit`) — they author briefs and reports rather than touching product behavior, so there is no product-invariants surface to align against. Confine the alignment check to whatever `CLAUDE.md` conventions apply, and mark the rest N/A.

3. **Session reflection.** Review the conversation for:
   - Moments where the skill's instructions were unclear or ambiguous
   - Steps that were skipped, reordered, or worked around
   - Behaviors the skill didn't anticipate (edge cases, unexpected inputs)
   - Places where Claude had to improvise because the skill gave no guidance
   - Outcomes that diverged from what the skill intended
   - Steps not exercised this session (mark "not exercised" — do not speculate about them)

   **Self-audit** (target is `skill-audit` itself): use evidence from any prior audit **and/or follow-up-implementation** invocation(s) this session — the Step 8 implementation phase (Read-before-Edit handling, the intra-skill cascade scan, the cross-skill grep, post-edit verification) is in evidence scope, not just Steps 1–7, since those are the steps that actually mutate files. If there were none, report "No session evidence available — self-audit with no prior invocations" and skip steps 3–6.

4. **Cross-check alignment.** For each finding, check whether the skill contradicts or fails to implement conventions from `CLAUDE.md` (by section name) — skip if `CLAUDE.md` is absent.

5. **Classify each finding** into one bucket:
   - **Issue** — something broken, misleading, or contradictory in the skill
   - **Improvement** — a refinement to existing behavior that would make the skill more effective
   - **Feature** — a new capability that fits the skill's stated intent but is currently missing

6. **Severity-tag each finding** — CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW:
   - **CRITICAL** — skill produces wrong output, corrupts state, or violates a stated repo convention (e.g. a `CLAUDE.md` rule). Fix before next use.
   - **HIGH** — a missing guardrail/instruction that already caused rework or wrong output this session, or a plausible near-term failure on next use. A follow-up round produced by the skill's *own* designed graceful-deferral path (a flagged note with a trigger that the user opts into) is MEDIUM, not HIGH — "rework" means output that had to be redone because of a gap, not a planned continuation the skill anticipated.
   - **MEDIUM** — friction that cost non-trivial improvisation or non-obvious judgment to work around; the right outcome still emerged, but the path wasn't smooth.
   - **LOW** — wording refinement, coverage gap, or polish that didn't block progress.

   **Present-but-unsurfaced instructions** — when the skill already contains the right instruction but it failed in practice this session (missed because it was buried, mis-placed, or easy to skip), grade it by *impact*: a wrong or dropped output makes it HIGH, mere friction makes it MEDIUM, and no material impact (cosmetic ordering or phrasing only) makes it LOW. Classify it as an **Improvement** (a prominence/placement refinement), not an Issue. An instruction that was present but *deliberately worked around* (a reasonable-but-unsanctioned path taken in the moment) is likewise an **Improvement**, graded by impact or plausible-failure risk — target the missing provision that made the workaround necessary or attractive, not the instruction's wording. "Missing guardrail/instruction" in the HIGH definition covers an instruction that is effectively missing at the moment of use, not only one absent from the file.

   **Pre-finalization verification** — before finalizing any finding tagged MEDIUM or higher whose Suggestion or Skill-gap field claims content is absent, missing, or undocumented, or mis-cites a specific location (phrasings like "Add X", "there is no documented Y", "the skill never mentions Z", "§Section currently reads…"), verify the claim by a Read or grep of the cited file/section *before* writing the finding. The 30-second check keeps the report's premises true to the file's actual state, rather than to which content you happened to load. In-context content from an earlier Read this session satisfies this when the file is unmodified since (re-read after compaction or if the file changed) — the point is that the cited state is current, not that the bytes were re-fetched. LOW findings are exempt from the mandatory check, but verify ad-hoc when you're unsure a claim holds.

7. **Present the report** using the template below. Output it to the conversation — do not write a file, do not modify the target.

## Report template

```markdown
# Skill Audit: <skill-name>

**Skill path**: <path>
**Session date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Session summary**: <1–2 sentences on the session work that exercised the target skill>

## Alignment Check

- **CLAUDE.md**: <aligned / N deviations found / skipped — not present>
- **Product invariants**: N/A — meta-tooling skill
[If deviations: bullets naming the specific `CLAUDE.md` section and what conflicts]

## Issues

[If none: "No issues identified."]

1. **[SEVERITY]** <title>
   - **What happened**: <session evidence — what went wrong or was confusing>
   - **Skill gap**: <what the skill says or fails to say that caused this>
   - **Suggestion**: <how to fix the skill>

## Improvements

[If none: "No improvements identified."]

1. **[SEVERITY]** <title>
   - **Current behavior**: <what the skill currently says>
   - **Why improve**: <session evidence or reasoning>
   - **Suggestion**: <proposed change>

## Features

[If none: "No features identified."]

1. **[SEVERITY]** <title>
   - **What's missing**: <gap description>
   - **Why it fits**: <how this aligns with the skill's stated intent>
   - **Suggestion**: <proposed addition>

## Not Exercised This Session

[Optional — omit when every step/branch was exercised. Otherwise one-line bullets naming steps or branches the session didn't trigger, surfacing coverage gaps without speculating about them.]

## Summary

**Total**: N issues, N improvements, N features (N findings) — N CRITICAL, N HIGH, N MEDIUM, N LOW
```

## Report conventions

- **Suggestion specificity** — when a fix could land in either `SKILL.md` or a `references/` file, cite the exact path (e.g., "Add to `references/X.md` §Section"). The bare `§Section` form is fine when the section name is unique across the skill's files.
- **Severity-count double-check** — verify the Summary counts against the findings before presenting; if you correct a count after presenting, strike the wrong line and restate.
- **Required platform appendices** — if higher-priority platform/tool instructions require citation or footer blocks (for example memory citations), append them after `## Summary`. Do not count required appendices as findings, Issues, Improvements, Features, or Not Exercised coverage.
- **Implement-all by default** — "implement all", "implement recommended", "implement suggestions" are synonymous: apply every numbered finding. Anything worth numbering is worth implementing. To surface a finding *without* auto-applying it, tag it on the title line: `— skip` (considered and declined), `— informational` (context, no code change), or append `— no change needed` to the Suggestion line. Tagged findings are excluded from "implement all"; everything else is applied.

## Follow-up implementation (Step 8, on user request)

After the report, the user may ask you to implement specific findings (or all of them). Now editing the target file is permitted — the report-only guardrail applied to the audit phase only.

1. **Scope** — partial ("implement 1 and 3") vs. inclusive ("implement all" / "implement recommended", synonymous). Findings are section-prefixed (`Issue 1`, `Improvement 1`, `Feature 1`); "implement 1 and 3" defaults to the Issues counter — confirm the section if the count is ambiguous.
2. **Re-evaluation** — if any covered file changed since the report, or a re-read shows an audit premise was falsified (it claimed X absent but X is present, or vice versa), re-evaluate each finding against the current state first: discard moot findings, adapt shifted ones, announce the outcome per finding. When nothing changed and no premise was falsified, a single confirmation line suffices.
3. **Read before Edit** — every file you will Edit must have been Read in this session via the Read tool. In-context content from grep/Bash/skill-invocation output does *not* satisfy the Edit tool's validator. For large files, chunked Reads (`offset`/`limit`) covering each edit region satisfy it. In Codex sessions, satisfy the same intent with explicit file reads in the current context and use `apply_patch` for edits; do not create or edit files with shell write tricks. A grep-only hit is useful for locating text, but it does not replace reading the edit region.
4. **Apply edits in document order** (top → bottom) to avoid line-shift breakage; parallel Edit batching is fine when each `old_string` is unique and non-overlapping. Construct `old_string`s from a fresh targeted Read rather than from audit-phase memory — whitespace and list markers are easily misremembered. The location a finding's Suggestion cited is a recommendation, not binding; if a better-fitting home emerges during implementation, place it there and note the deviation in the status row (Step 8.7).
5. **Intra-skill cascade scan** — after planning each primary edit, scan the rest of the skill's files for related text using the same terminology, concept, or count that would go stale if only the primary changed (search semantic variants too: plurals, count phrases like "three categories", word-form numbers). Apply cascades alongside the primary. Key them `N.cascade` in the summary; when one finding needs co-equal parallel edits at several sites, key `N.a` / `N.b` instead. When an edit touches a *shared* surface (terminology, a convention, or an output path such as `reports/` or `docs/`), also run the Cross-skill check below — **list `.claude/skills/` first** to refresh the sibling set, then grep the affected siblings — before finishing the implementation. When enumerating multi-site edits by grep, capture the matched token itself (e.g. `grep -o` with a surrounding anchor, or untruncated matching lines) rather than width-truncated previews — a site whose match lies past the truncation point silently drops from the edit plan; token-anchored output stays small without hiding matches.
6. **Post-edit verification** — re-read each edited file (full file if short; edited regions with flanking context if long) and confirm: edits don't conflict; numbering/steps/sections stay sequential; cross-references and file paths still resolve; the skill reads coherently end-to-end; YAML frontmatter still parses if touched. When the harness confirms the post-edit file state is current in your context, that state satisfies the re-read — the obligation is the coherence checks themselves, not a byte re-fetch (a targeted grep/anchored read still verifies cross-file references); re-read from disk only after compaction or an external change. When sweeping for residual stale tokens after a rename/renumber fix, check each hit against the old→new mapping — a hit equal to a *new* (corrected) value is a false positive; avoid numeric-range patterns that span both old and new values. Fix and re-run the full pass if any check fails.
7. **Post-implementation summary** — a status row per finding (`implemented` / `relocated — implemented at <section> rather than the report's suggested <section>, because <reason>` / `cascade from finding N — <reason>` / `co-edit with finding M` / `skipped — <reason>`), so the user gets a clear per-finding outcome.

## Cross-skill note

**First, list `.claude/skills/`** to get the current sibling set — do not rely on a hardcoded enumeration, which goes stale as skills are added. Run this listing *before* selecting which siblings to grep, so a newly-added sibling is not silently missed. A cross-skill check matters only when a follow-up edit introduces or changes terminology, a convention, or an output path (e.g. `reports/`, or a shared concept like the manifest that `research-brief` produces) that a sibling skill also relies on — in that case, grep the relevant sibling(s) for the affected token and record the outcome (`Scanned <sibling> via grep for <token> — no inconsistencies`, or name what was found/adjusted). Sibling hits are **surfaced, not silently fixed**: edit a sibling only when (a) the user's implementation request covers it, or (b) the co-edit is mechanically required for the just-made edit's consistency (shared terminology the primary edit changed); otherwise record the hits and recommend a follow-up audit/fix. When no edit touches a shared surface, omit any cross-skill section entirely. As the skill ecosystem grows, extend the scan to whichever siblings share the affected surface. When the affected token is a repo-wide convention (output paths, the `reports/` manifest format, doc-pack layout under `docs/`), extend the same grep to shared non-skill contract files (e.g. `docs/worldbuilding-system/README.md`, existing `reports/` manifests) and to the full sibling set — including siblings never previously flagged — with the same surfaced-not-fixed default.

## Auxiliary investigation and announcements

Beyond reading the target `SKILL.md`, you may list its directory, read or grep sibling skills, and diff files against named reference sources — but each auxiliary call must support a specific hypothesis about the target's behavior, not probe speculatively. **Announce any tool call beyond the target Read hypothesis-first**, as user-facing text immediately before the call: `Investigating <hypothesis>: <grep/read/list> <target> to verify.` This keeps the audit trail reproducible. A tool's `description` field does not satisfy this — it doesn't render where reproducibility needs it.

## Guardrails

- **Report only** during the audit phase — output to the conversation, never modify the target. Step 8 follow-up implementation is the sole exception, scoped to user-directed requests.
- **No false positives** — a step not exercised this session is noted "not exercised", never speculated about as an issue.
- **Convention alignment is mandatory** — any suggestion that would violate a stated repo convention (e.g. a `CLAUDE.md` rule) must be flagged and rejected, even if it would otherwise improve the skill.
- **Scope discipline** — evaluate the skill as written against its stated intent; don't propose expanding its scope.
- **Session evidence required** — every Issue and Improvement cites specific session evidence (what happened, what was expected). Purely hypothetical gaps belong in Features.
- **Repeated-audit shortcut** — if the same skill was audited 2+ times this session and the most recent audit found 0 findings with no intervening edits, note "Skill stable — no new session evidence since last audit" and skip the full checklist. If the skill was modified since the last audit, treat the next audit as fresh.
